# COVID-19 Impact on Food Prices in Developing Countries

This project analyzes the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on basic food commodity prices across developing nations. The study focuses on identifying economic and geographical patterns in price changes and their relationship to socioeconomic factors like the Human Development Index (HDI) and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.

## Objectives

- Investigate the relationship between Human Development Index (HDI) and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita in developing countries
- Analyse the impact of COVID-19 on basic food commodity prices (2019-2021)
- Explore correlations between development indicators and post-pandemic food prices
- Visualise the geographical distribution of food price changes across the developing world

## Methodology

- Data Sources: World Population Review (developing countries data) and FAO FAOSTAT (producer prices)
- Tech: Python (pandas, matplotlib, geopandas), data visualization, and geospatial analysis
- Time Period: 2019-2021 (pre and post COVID-19 impact)
- Commodities: Basic food items including grains, vegetables, fruits, meat, and animal products
- Analysis: Statistical correlation, regression analysis, and choropleth mapping

## Key Insights

- Strong HDI-GNI correlation: Found a significant positive correlation (0.7461) between GNI per capita and HDI in developing countries
- Widespread price increases: Majority of developing countries experienced food price increases during the pandemic period
- Geographic impact variation: Iran showed the highest price increase (200%), while Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Egypt, and Bangladesh also faced significant impacts
- Limited HDI-price relationship: No significant correlation found between HDI levels and 2021 food prices, suggesting other factors drive price volatility

## Visualizations

- Scatter plots showing HDI vs GNI per capita relationships with regression analysis
- Bar charts displaying the COVID-19 impact distribution across countries
- Choropleth world map illustrating geographical patterns of food price changes

## Limitations

- Limited commodity coverage across all countries in the dataset
- Varying number of commodities per country affecting comparison accuracy
- Missing data for some countries requiring estimation techniques
- Focus limited to producer prices rather than consumer prices
